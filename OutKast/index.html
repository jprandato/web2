				<div id="firstparagraph"><p> Before there was love below, there were boos. The two dope boys in a Cadillac had made a left turn and wound up in the middle of a civil war at Madison Square Garden's Paramount Theater on a soggy August night in 1995. Brawls erupted in the audience. Tensions were hair-trigger. When OutKast shocked the Source Awards audience by winning Best New Rap Group, it was like being fed to the firing squad.</p></div> 

				<p>The first shots took the form of words. Earlier that evening, Suge Knight&#8212;6-foot-3, 330 pounds, Blood-red button-up shirt&#8212;glowered at the audience like a hellbound offensive lineman: &#8220;If any artists out there want to be artists and stay a star&#8230; and don&#8217;t want to worry about the executive producer&#8230; all in the videos&#8230; all on the records... dancing.&#8221; Knight let that last word linger, a personal grenade hurled at Puff Daddy. &#8220;Come to Death Row!&#8221;</p>  

				<p>Snoop Dogg escalated the confrontation to the entire seaboard: &#8220;The East Coast don&#8217;t got no love for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg and Death Row?&#8221; he sneered, marine-blue bandanna tied around his neck, brandishing a club at the hostile New York crowd&#8212;a murder trial already awaiting him back home. &#8220;Well&#8230; let it be known!&#8221;</p>

<p>OutKast was collateral damage. It didn&#8217;t matter that Puffy directed the video for their debut single, &#8220;Players Ball&#8221;, or that they&#8217;d previously opened up for Biggie. The New York crowd only acknowledged Bad Boys and boom-bap. Mobb Deep. Boot Camp Clik. Nas. Wu-Tang or protect your neck. They looked at the southern players like country cousins eating chitlins and smoking stress. What good is a '77 Seville when you&#8217;re riding the subway? </p> 

<p>This mentality missed Atlanta's Andre Benjamin and Antwan Patton. Their red clay funk emerged from the Dungeon&#8212;the nickname for the basement studio owned by Rico Wade, one third of their production squad, Organized Noize. They&#8217;d come up on Brand Nubian, Poor Righteous Teachers, A Tribe Called Quest, and Rakim, just like everyone else in the room. They&#8217;d break danced and bought Ron G mixtapes at the 5 Points Flea Market. Their realness was beyond reproach. </p> 

<p>The heckling that night transcended personal disrespect; it implicitly attacked the drawl, slang, and soul food of the culture that spawned them. As Andre threatened on the duo's platinum-selling 1994 debut albumSouthernplayalisticadillacmuzik: &#8220;Talk bad about the A-Town and I&#8217;ll bust you in your fucking mouth.&#8221; Barely 20 years old, Dre had yet to adopt the &#8220;3000.&#8221; He&#8217;d recently gone sober, vegetarian, and grown dreads, swapping his Braves jersey for a polyester turban. Standing before a crowd in Karl Kani, Phat Farm, and Versace, OutKast looked and felt alien. The meaning of the group&#8217;s name had come to life in front of the howling mob. Andre silenced them with six words: &#8220;The South got something to say.&#8221;</p>

<p>OutKast understood that the most profound answers are often implied. Rappers unable to exit their own orbit might have directly addressed the incident at the Source Awards. OutKast located it within a deeper pattern of dislocation. They were able to internalize the last century of black musical visionaries including Son House, Chuck Berry, Jimi Hendrix, James Brown, Curtis Mayfield, Sly Stone, George Clinton, Prince. But they also completely lack precedent. They take you from Atlanta to Atlantis and back in the same stanza. 
Their identity as outsiders gave them perspective, their empathy allowed them to connect, and their wisdom offered the ability to see through bullshit. They could write a song about &#8220;floating face down in the mainstream&#8221; on a certified platinum album. We routinely celebrate the contradictions of artists as a badge of complexity, but OutKast was the rarity able to reconcile commerce, human decency, and purity of vision. There are no cynical radio grabs. No guest appearances from that season&#8217;s hot rapper. Every musical decision is organic.</p> 

<p>The name illustrated their approach. Earlier aliases included 2 Shades Deep and the Misfits&#8212;the latter nixed after a teenaged discovery of Glenn Danzig. Both were literal outcasts as new students in the 10th grade at Tri Cities High. Andre skateboarded, wore floral print shirts, and rode BMX bikes. He grew up across the street from the projects, where they watched fights out of the window for fun.</p>  

<p>Big Boi soaked up a country influence during his early years in Savannah. In high school, he maintained a 3.68 grade point average and a secret Kate Bush obsession. Most of their classmates bumped bass music. When they auditioned for Rico Wade, they freestyled for eight minutes over the instrumental to Tribe&#8217;s &#8220;Scenario&#8221;.</p>  

<p>During an era when artists were expected to choose sides, OutKast opted out of false binaries. They&#8217;re haunted by flashbacks of injustice while rolling in Eldorados through East Point. But they realize that it&#8217;s more honest to confront your past than run away from it. The slang, finger waves, and Mo-Joe&#8217;s chicken wings were in their DNA. So were UGK, 8Ball &amp; MJG, and the Rap-A-Lot artists who first gave a voice to the South. Not to mention the entire Dungeon Family, whose influence on OutKast is unrivaled.</p>

<p>Southernplayalisticadalicmusik was the coming of age story of two baby-faced hustlers puffing and pimping in Adidas and Khakis. Organized Noize&#8217;s greasy Muscle Shoals funk, 808 booty-bass drums, and grimy East Coast SP-1200 slaps wrote the template for every dirty south rap album with aspirations of being soulful.</p>  

<p>When OutKast called themselves &#8220;ATLiens,&#8221; it was a partial rupture. They set themselves apart from their city and species&#8212;weird storms in the wrong season. But they also identify with the soil and struggle. They are black men in the South, where Confederate ghosts and rebel flags are constant shadows. As they lament on Southernplayalistic&#8217;s &#8220;Git Up, Get Out&#8221;, no one&#8217;s running for office but &#8220;crackers.&#8221; Yet the song&#8217;s message is deceptively traditional: Quit smoking your life away, pay attention to your parents, rely only on yourself.</p> 



<p>ATLiens was the act of levitation. Every time you look in the sky, they&#8217;re back in the Dungeon, staring at ceiling fans searching for inspiration. When you search for them in the Dungeon, they&#8217;re at the mall getting harassed by hyena-like fanboys. They dip from outer space to honor everyone from their Atlanta bass predecessors to Afrika Bambaataa and Grandmaster Flash. After all, everyone liked Kraftwerk.</p>  

<p>The last song on 1996&#8217;s ATLiens is called &#8220;13th Floor/Growing Old&#8221;. It&#8217;s a hymnal, a sermon against avarice and sin, a confessional, a declaration of black solidarity and southern pride&#8212;a meditation on the transience of existence. It&#8217;s a psalm for those still searching: church music that&#8217;s been secularized, cosmic dub, gospel music given an extraterrestrial groove. Then the scratches hit you: &#8220;Ninety-six gonna be that year.&#8221; This is hip-hop.</p>  

<p>Most rap albums are rooted in some mixture of the present and the past. ATLiens hovers over both&#8212;with one eye wired to the future. It explores catacomb thoughts at 3 a.m.: mortality, exclusion, spirituality, consequences, and the desire to transcend. It&#8217;s mournful and ethereal, but still street. It expanded what rappers could talk about and how it could sound. If OutKast were going to take the pulpit, they needed a church to preach in.</p>

<p>First they were pimps. Then they were aliens or genies. Then no one knew what to call them. The Aquemini liner notes capture Andre adorned in a platinum glamour wig, bumblebee yellow jersey, and sunglasses that ostensibly inspired &quot;Adventure Time&quot;. Another shot makes him look like the man in the yellow hat from Curious George leading the Grambling Marching Band.</p>  

<p>All doubts were crushed on the album&#8217;s first raps. Snapping on those who get the &#8220;wrong impression of expression,&#8221; Andre shuts up whispers about whether he&#8217;s on drugs or gay. Rap had seen afro-futurist eccentrics before, but since hard-core hit in &#8217;94, no one but Kool Keith had dressed so flamboyantly. (And even Keith disguised himself as Dr. Octagon or Black Elvis.) </p>  

<p>Andre had reached that rarefied level of &#8220;I don't give a fuck&#8221; that Kanye West has frantically sought since his first Givenchy kilt. His clothes weren&#8217;t a bug-out costume or artistic pose; they felt as creatively surreal as the music. No one on earth or Alpha Centauri could have convincingly pulled them off. Ask Fonzworth Bentley.</p>

<p>The penultimate song on Aquemini is a nearly nine-minute underwater spiritual called &#8220;Liberation&#8221;. Guests include Cee-Lo, Erykah Badu, and Dungeon Family high priest Big Rube. Like the album itself, it is many things at once. It&#8217;s a psychic liberation from genre, expectations, and lingering shreds of convention. It is a manifesto of self-determination, free expression, and a requiem for the enslaved. It is funk. It is soul. It is hip-hop. It is gospel. It is swamp jazz, the blues, and remnants of oral tradition. Voodoo. It&#8217;s OutKast, astrologically intertwined and fully emancipated. </p> 

<p>Consensus generally favors Andre over Big Boi. This is a fatal misunderstanding of their partnership. If Andre steered more than half the journey on the first two records, Big Boi caught up by Aquemini. His flow is as liquid and low to the ground as a busted fire hydrant. Several hooks, including &#8220;Rosa Parks&#8221;, belong to him. If Andre is the interstellar satellite, Big Boi is the spy on the streets. The wildest indulgences have checks and balances. You need Big Boi to have Andre. The poet and the player was the tagline; the truth is that you never knew who was who.</p>  

<p>Aquemini is a declaration of total freedom without taking your toes out of the soil. Nearly every member of the Dungeon Family contributes memorably, but OutKast assumed more creative control than ever before. Andre started making beats, playing Kalimba, and recruiting gifted session musicians from around Atlanta. (The hoedown harmonica sizzle on &#8220;Rosa Parks&#8221; belongs to his step-dad, the Reverend Robert Hodo.) George Clinton appears on a song that sounds like it was written for a Terry Gilliam adaptation of Brave New World.</p>  </div>

<p>It&#8217;s a capsule of a time, place, and movement, but never feels dated. No hip-hop album before or since blended such rich musicality with artful narrative. When Andre opens &#8220;Da Art of Storytellin&#8217; (Part 2)&#8221; with a storm warning, the beat and vocal effects batter like a hurricane. &#8220;SpottieOttieDopaliscious&#8221; sounds as sentimental and drunk as the narrator engulfed in Old E, who never made it to the disco door. Samples are sparse. It&#8217;s not old music being re-interpreted; it&#8217;s old ideas being reincarnated.</p> 

<p>During the late 90s, rap typically gravitated towards either austerity or excess. Aquemini matched neither category. &#8220;Skew it on the Bar-B&#8221; is as lean as an ostrich. &#8220;Nathaniel&#8221; is a 70-second rap dialed-in from jail&#8212;just long enough to acknowledge those still waiting to be set free. Half the songs snake past five minutes. No single cracked the Top 40, yet the album went double platinum. </p> 

 <p>Released on the same day&#8212;September 29, 1998&#8212;as albums from Jay-Z, A Tribe Called Quest, and Black Star, OutKast earned the highest praise. The Source instantly canonized Aquemini with the first perfect score ever given to a Southern rap act. That fact might feel like a footnote 15 years later, but at the time, it was a coronation. (I&#8217;ll never forget a guy on my high school basketball team in Los Angeles buying the magazine and screaming outside the gym like a town crier: &#8220;OUTKAST GOT FIVE MICS IN THE SOURCE!!!!&#8221;) They opened the door for the entire region. If you listen to OutKast&#8217;s last words on Aquemini, you'll hear a familiar phrase: &#8220;The South got something to say.&#8221;</p> 


<p>Stankonia. The studio name seems like an afro-futurist Xanadu. Between their third and fourth albums, OutKast acquired and re-blessed Bobby Brown&#8217;s &#8220;Bosstown&#8221; in downtown Atlanta. The former house of &#8220;Humpin' Around&#8221; became hip-hop&#8217;s Electric Ladyland, Paisley Park, or Abbey Road&#8212;a place where merely invoking the name inspires psychedelic shades and astral sounds.</p> 
	
<p>You&#8217;d think that starting your album with the chanted hook, &#8220;burn muthafucka, burn American dream,&#8221; would do little to endear you to the American record buying public. Political rap had been commercial kryptonite since Ice Cube first met Smokey. But Stankonia transformed OutKast from Southern vanguards into the most universally beloved rappers in the world. They crossed over from &quot;MTV Jams&quot; to triple-platinum &quot;TRL&quot; staples. They won two Grammys. They became the token group worshipped by people who hated hip-hop &#8220;except for...&#8221;</p>

<p>OutKast mastered the art of sending mixed messages. They tell you that hip-hop is more than just guns and alcohol&#8212;but admit that it&#8217;s that too. Buried beneath the sweet contrition of  #1 single &#8220;Ms. Jackson&#8221; is the sad disintegration of love and a child caught in the crossfire. Stankonia might initially channel Public Enemy, but it quickly shifts into &#8220;So Fresh, So Clean&#8221;, a blue tuxedo-soul ode to gator belts, patty melts, and Monte Carlos. Official remixes followed from Fatboy Slim and Snoop Dogg. Andre even shouted out his love of drum and bass in interviews. The evidence is &#8220;B.O.B.&#8221;, the only song murderous enough to one-up England&#8217;s the Prodigy and appeal to fans of Prodigy from Queensbridge.</p> 



<p>The back-and-forth between hip-hop and dance music had existed since Chic&#8217;s &#8220;Good Times&#8221; became &#8220;Rapper&#8217;s Delight&#8221;, but during the early 00s, the genre was in a particularly insular zone. A generation emerged with few musical reference points outside of rap. When Stankonia won the Best Rap Album Grammy in 2002, it beat out Ja Rule, Eve, and Ludacris (and, to be fair, Jay-Z&#8217;s The Blueprint). The victory was a reminder of how far out the groove could extend.</p>  

<p>The civil war had shifted from East vs. West to underground vs. commercial. OutKast might have shared the subterranean allergy towards pop concessions, but they rejected ideology or false purity. You can make a great rap album using only four tracks; OutKast were using all 88 and knew the difference. Andre described it best when he said, &quot;We&#8217;re in the age of keeping it real, but we&#8217;re trying to keep it surreal.&quot;</p> 


<p>But even surrealism needs the occasional contrast. OutKast clocked substantial hours in outer space, but still made time to check back in on the block. Despite the rainbow funk jams and Purple One falsetto, the album also introduced Killer Mike and explained why you should never let gold diggers order strawberry lemonade and popcorn shrimp at the Cheesecake Factory. There are skits about prenuptial agreements. &#8220;Toilet Tisha&#8221; loosely resembles Prince re-imagining &#8220;Brenda&#8217;s Got a Baby&#8221;.</p> 

<p>In hindsight, you can see the beginning of the creative rifts. The pair traveled separately. Many of Andre&#8217;s beats started with him riffing on an acoustic guitar at home. And judging by the amount of abstraction and aqueous funk jams, you can generally figure out what is a Big Boi idea and what is an Andre 3000 one. Stankonia is OutKast at their most experimental, meandering, and free. It is rap&#8217;s White Album. No idea is too bizarre. Each song could spark its own sub-genre&#8212;if you even knew where to begin.</p> 



<p>Samuel L. Jackson introduced OutKast as &#8220;the music of inclusion&#8221; at the 2004 Grammys, but Big Boi and Andre didn&#8217;t perform together. Instead, Big Boi crooned his #1 single &#8220;The Way You Move&#8221; backed by Earth, Wind &amp; Fire as part of a funk tribute, and Andre closed out the show with his own #1 single, &#8220;Hey Ya&#8221;. He wore a fringed neon green jumpsuit, green headband, silver boots, and displayed copious nipple. There were back-up dancers, explosions, a marching band, and massive rapture. No boos occurred until the next day, when Native American activists publicly demanded an apology from Andre and CBS for perpetuating stereotypes. Jimi Hendrix&#8217;s estate let the homage slide. After all, the proper context was evident.</p> 

<p>Speakerboxxx/The Love Below took home three Grammy&#8217;s that night. During their winner&#8217;s speech for Album of the Year, Andre interrupted himself to tell the crowd that Stankonia wasn&#8217;t their first album. &#8220;Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik,&#8221; he said, repeating it twice to let it sink in. </p>

<p>Nine years had elapsed since the Source Awards. Biggie and 2Pac had become rap&#8217;s martyred saints. Suge Knight was incarcerated. Snoop Dogg had signed and left the South&#8217;s No Limit Records and his biggest hit that year was &#8220;Drop It Like It&#8217;s Hot&#8221;, with a beat courtesy of Virginia&#8217;s Neptunes. Bad Boy generally amounted to Puffy commanding &#8220;da band&#8221; to fetch him cheesecake. While New York&#8217;s biggest star, 50 Cent, was propelled by Dr. Dre&#8217;s production and a sing-song flow lifted from Southern rap. </p> 

<p>OutKast had not only become the most successful rap group of all-time, they were the biggest band on Earth. The Love Below/Speakerboxxx sold 11 million copies and swept almost every critic&#8217;s poll. There are people who think the Beatles are too sappy. Prince is too weird. Radiohead is too icy. James Brown wore everything a little too tight. But everyone agrees on OutKast. At their peak, the duo&#8217;s popularity rivaled income tax refunds, cute puppies, and free samples. </p> 

<p>The last official OutKast album was 2006&#8217;s Idlewild, which doubled as a soundtrack to the much-delayed film of the same name. There are experiments with blues, vaudeville, marching bands, and Lil Wayne&#8212;who had eclipsed the mostly inactive group as the Southern standard-bearer. The album essentially amounts to a bonus track tacked onto the end of their union.</p> 

<p>You can spot their influence across contemporary music: Kendrick Lamar, Cee-Lo, Curren$y, B.o.B., Big K.R.I.T., Janelle Mon&#225;e, even Tyler, the Creator. Andre defined the idea of the eccentric genius for a generation. Yet OutKast is inimitable. There is no blueprint or trail of crumbs. You listen to their records and wonder how they did it. It&#8217;s like visiting the pyramids and concluding that they had to be the handiwork of aliens.</p>  

<p>Roughly twice a year, Andre or Big Boi gives an interview that journalists and fans tout as evidence of a future OutKast album. The rumors are inevitably and quickly crushed. Andre remains free to star in shaving-cream campaigns and vent on the occasional guest verse. Big Boi releases solo albums and tours the country, the janissary to their memory, still spitting Southern player raps over saxophone funk.</p> 

<p>But even though they haven&#8217;t made music in a decade, they didn&#8217;t break up. They still represent what they stood for. There is no acrimony or sad cash-in reunion tours. We remember them the way we remember those who died at their peak: permanently immortal, practically perfect. They had managed to say it all.</p>
