		<p><span>My intent with this project</span> is to build out and sort a collection of plotted coordinates over a map. The data points were previously gathered for the 100 Things project from Information Architecture 1 (from my junior year).</p>
		<p><span>The collection</span> showcases 100 anchorage and mooring locations, plotted over Narragansett Bay in Rhode Island. In the previous project, the points were sorted by the distance from our hailing port, neighborhoods, prices, common boats, and activities.For the sake of this project, I'm aiming to keep the first three classifications for filtering the data.</p>
